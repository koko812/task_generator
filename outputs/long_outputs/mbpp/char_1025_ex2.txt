In this task, you are challenged to develop Python functions that address specific programming problems, each requiring a different approach and set of skills. For example, one problem may involve finding the largest integers from a list, which not only tests your ability to handle lists and sort data but also your understanding of algorithms that can efficiently retrieve the desired elements. Another problem may focus on identifying non-prime numbers, which requires a foundational understanding of number theory and the ability to implement loops and conditional statements effectively. Each task is designed to enhance your coding proficiency, encouraging you to think critically about how to structure your code for clarity and efficiency. The use of assertions to test your functions adds an extra layer of rigor, ensuring that your solutions are robust and reliable. By engaging with these tasks, you will strengthen your programming skills and deepen your understanding of fundamental concepts in computer science.
