In this task, you are required to write functions that solve specific problems presented in a prompt format. Each problem demands a unique approach, whether it's checking for close elements in a list of numbers, separating nested parentheses from a string, or extracting the decimal part of a floating-point number. The skills needed for this task include a strong foundation in programming principles, particularly in Python, where you will utilize data types such as lists and strings. Problem-solving skills are vital as you will need to analyze the problem, devise an algorithm, and implement it in code. Additionally, attention to detail is important to ensure that the function handles various inputs correctly and efficiently. You will also need to consider edge cases and ensure that your solution is both optimal and easy to understand. This task not only tests your coding abilities but also your capacity to think critically and logically to arrive at a solution that meets the outlined requirements.
