Here are some examples of the tasks you will be asked to solve.

## Example 1
Question: Five men and nine women stand equally spaced around a circle in random order. The probability that every man stands diametrically opposite a woman is $\frac{m}{n},$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n.$

Answer: #### 191

## Example 2
Question: Positive real numbers $b \neq 1$ and $n$ satisfy the equations
\[\sqrt{\log_b n} = \log_b \sqrt{n} \qquad \text{and} \qquad b \cdot \log_b n = \log_b (bn).\]
The value of $n$ is $\frac{j}{k},$ where $j$ and $k$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $j+k.$

Answer: #### 881

## Example 3
Question: A plane contains $40$ lines, no $2$ of which are parallel. Suppose there are $3$ points where exactly $3$ lines intersect, $4$ points where exactly $4$ lines intersect, $5$ points where exactly $5$ lines intersect, $6$ points where exactly $6$ lines intersect, and no points where more than $6$ lines intersect. Find the number of points where exactly $2$ lines intersect.

Answer: #### 607
